# SmartLibrary

Library management is a tedious process, which involves the regular updating of many 
files and records. The library staff have to keep a track of many records such as student details, 
book details, etc., and maintain a number of registers. Doing this manually involves a lot of time 
and labour. Hence this can be made easy through automation. 
Smart e-Library System is an application software project being put forward in the period of 
transformation in research areas of traditional library science to information science and data science. 
Data stored in a data centre unused is a burden, which if correctly processed can become digital gold. 
The Smart e-Library System proposed here provides the feature of inbuilt data visualisation to enable 
librarians to analyse data and spot patterns and trends which can be used to enhance library 
management. It provides the feature to automatically send e-mails from the library to the library 
members. Thus, this is an application to enhance library management with the features of inbuilt data 
visualisation; automatic e-mailing and automation of library services with a highly efficient user 
interface. Automation will be achieved through the computerisation of library services; data 
visualisation, automatic e-mailing and an efficient user interface will be achieved using Java 
technologies. 
In the Smart e-Library system project, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) will be developed using 
Java Swing API. Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC). JFCs contains features for 
building Graphical User Interfaces. They are a set of GUI components which simplify the 
development of desktop applications. database will be implemented using MySQL Database 
Management System, database connectivity will be achieved with Java Database Connectivity 
(JDBC) API, data visualisation will be achieved using Xchart Java library, automatic e-mailing will 
be achieved using Java Mail API and efficient user interface will be implemented through the Java 
program. The APIs and/or JAR files and/or dependencies are brought to the system through the use 
of the Maven software project management and comprehension tool.
