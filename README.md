# SmartLibrary

The basic idea behind the development of the Smart e-Library System is to increase the 
effectiveness of library management system through the automation of library services.  
The Smart e-Library System provides the feature of inbuilt data visualisation to enable librarians 
to analyse data and spot patterns and trends which can be used to enhance library management. 
It provides the feature to automatically send e-mails from the library to the library members. To 
use the application, users need to login through user verification. Thus, this is an application to 
enhance library management with the features of inbuilt data visualisation, automatic e-mailing 
and an efficient user interface along with automation of library services.  
This System stores the following information: Book details, Member details, User details, Book 
issue, Book genres, Book authors, Publishers, Languages, Book availability notification 
preferences.
